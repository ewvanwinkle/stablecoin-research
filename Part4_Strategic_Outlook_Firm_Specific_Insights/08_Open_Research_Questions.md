# 8. Open Research Questions for PE Due Diligence

This document outlines critical open questions for our firm's ongoing research and due diligence into the stablecoin, CBDC, and broader digital asset ecosystem. These questions are designed to probe strategic, operational, regulatory, and technical aspects to identify key investment theses and risks.

### Market Structure & Competitive Dynamics

1.  **"Picks and Shovels" Thesis:** What are the detailed business models and margin profiles of the "picks and shovels" companies in the stablecoin value chain (e.g., compliance-as-a-service providers, on-chain identity services, qualified custodians, and institutional-grade oracle providers)? Which of these sub-sectors is most defensible against commoditization?
2.  **B2B Payments Market Penetration:** What is the true total addressable market (TAM) for B2B cross-border payments using stablecoins? What are the primary remaining barriers (technological, regulatory, behavioral) preventing stablecoins from capturing a larger share of the traditional correspondent banking and SWIFT-based market?
3.  **Future of Exchanges & Liquidity:** How will the competitive dynamic between centralized exchanges (CEXes) and decentralized exchanges (DEXes) evolve for stablecoin liquidity? Can specialized DEX AMMs (like Curve) truly compete with the fiat on/off-ramps and network effects of CEXes for institutional-grade volume?
4.  **Non-USD Stablecoin Viability:** Beyond niche use cases, what is the realistic path to scale for non-USD stablecoins (e.g., EURC, XSGD) in a market where USD-pegged assets have such a powerful network effect? Is the primary opportunity in specific regulated markets or in providing forex diversification for DeFi?

### Yield-Bearing Stablecoins & Real-World Assets (RWAs)

5.  **Sustainable Yield Sources:** What are the most resilient and sustainable sources of yield for yield-bearing stablecoins? How significant is the risk profile of yield derived from perpetual futures funding rates (e.g., Ethena's USDe) versus yield from tokenized T-bills (e.g., Ondo's OUSG/BlackRock's BUIDL)?
6.  **Competitive Landscape of RWA Platforms:** What are the key moats for RWA tokenization platforms? Is the primary competitive advantage in regulatory licensing (e.g., Paxos), access to proprietary assets (e.g., Centrifuge and private credit), or technological innovation (e.g., Franklin Templeton's intraday yield)?
7.  **Institutional Adoption of Tokenized RWAs:** What are the primary operational and compliance hurdles still preventing widespread institutional adoption of tokenized RWAs? How critical are integrations like Centrifuge's use of Coinbase Verifications for streamlining institutional KYC/AML?
8.  **"Bankruptcy Remoteness" Standard:** How robust and legally tested is the concept of "bankruptcy remoteness" for structures like Ondo's USDY? Will this become a required standard for institutional-grade RWA products?

### Regulatory & Geopolitical Landscape

9.  **U.S. vs. EU Regulatory Divergence:** How will the divergent regulatory approaches between the US (pro-stablecoin) and the EU (pro-CBDC) impact global stablecoin issuers? Will this lead to a bifurcated market with separate product offerings and compliance structures for each region?
10. **Impact of Yield Prohibition:** What will be the long-term impact of the US GENIUS Act's prohibition on yield for "payment stablecoins"? Will this force a clear separation between transactional stablecoins and yield-bearing tokenized securities, and where will the most value accrue?
11. **CBDC Disintermediation Risk:** How significant is the risk of "fast disintermediation" for commercial banks if a retail CBDC is launched? Are proposed safeguards like the ECB's â‚¬3,000 holding limit for a digital euro sufficient to mitigate this risk without rendering the CBDC ineffective?
12. **The Future of Decentralized Stablecoins:** What is the long-term viable path for truly decentralized, crypto-collateralized stablecoins like DAI in a world of regulated, fiat-backed issuers and CBDCs? Can they remain relevant beyond the core DeFi user base, or will regulatory pressures force them into a niche?

### Technical & Operational Due Diligence

13. **Peg Stability & Reserve Quality:** Beyond attestations, what are the best practices for due diligence on the quality, liquidity, and risk profile of a fiat-collateralized stablecoin's reserves? What are the key red flags to look for in reserve composition reports?
14. **Smart Contract & Oracle Risk:** How can we effectively quantify the smart contract and oracle-related risks for protocols that are central to the stablecoin ecosystem (e.g., lending platforms, bridges)? What level of third-party auditing is sufficient for institutional-grade security?
15. **Cross-Chain Bridge Security:** What are the most secure models for cross-chain bridges? Given the history of significant exploits, is the "lock-and-mint" mechanism inherently more secure for institutional use cases than liquidity pool-based systems?
16. **Programmable Treasury Use Cases:** What are the most promising, yet underdeveloped, use cases for programmable money and automated treasury management for corporations? Which specific industries (e.g., logistics, manufacturing, international trade) are best positioned to benefit from these innovations first?
