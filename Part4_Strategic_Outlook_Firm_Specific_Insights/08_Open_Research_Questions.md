# 8. Big Questions for the Future

As this space evolves, there are still many fascinating and unanswered questions. Thinking about them is a good way to understand where the market might be heading and what challenges and opportunities lie ahead.

### Market Structure & Competition

1.  **The "Picks and Shovels" Ecosystem:** What are the actual business models of the "picks and shovels" companies? How do they make money, and how sustainable is it? Which of these areas—compliance tools, identity services, custody, oracles—is least likely to become a low-margin, commoditized business?
2.  **The B2B Payments Opportunity:** What's the real potential for stablecoins in B2B cross-border payments? What are the biggest hurdles—tech, regulation, or just old habits—that are stopping them from taking a bigger piece of the market from the traditional banking system?
3.  **Where Will Liquidity Live?** How will the battle for stablecoin liquidity between centralized exchanges (like Coinbase) and decentralized exchanges (like Curve) play out? Can the decentralized players really compete with the on-ramps and network effects of the big, centralized companies for serious volume?
4.  **Can Non-USD Stablecoins Compete?** Is there a realistic path for stablecoins pegged to something other than the US dollar (like the Euro) to gain real traction? Are they destined to be niche products, or can they find a major role in specific markets or for things like forex diversification in DeFi?

### Yield-Bearing Assets & RWA Tokenization

5.  **Where Does Sustainable Yield Come From?** What are the most reliable sources of yield for these new types of stablecoins? How should one think about the difference in risk between yield from complex derivatives (like Ethena's USDe) versus yield from tokenized T-bills (like BlackRock's BUIDL)?
6.  **What Makes an RWA Platform Successful?** What's the key competitive advantage for platforms that tokenize real-world assets? Is it getting the right regulatory licenses, having access to unique assets, or building better technology?
7.  **What's Holding Back Institutional Adoption?** What are the main operational or compliance headaches that are still keeping big institutions from diving into tokenized real-world assets? How important are new integrations that streamline the KYC/AML process?
8.  **The "Bankruptcy Proofing" Question:** How solid is the legal idea of "bankruptcy remoteness" for these new products? Is this going to become a non-negotiable standard for any serious, institutional-grade tokenized asset?

### The Regulatory & Geopolitical Scene

9.  **U.S. vs. EU Regulation:** How will the different regulatory paths in the U.S. (which favors stablecoins) and the EU (which favors a CBDC) affect the global market? Will we see a split market with different products for different regions?
10. **The Impact of Banning Yield:** What's the long-term effect of the U.S. banning yield payments on "payment stablecoins"? Will this create a clean split between simple coins for payments and different, regulated tokens for earning yield? Where does the value end up in that scenario?
11. **Could CBDCs Disrupt Banks?** How real is the risk that a retail CBDC could pull a lot of money out of commercial banks very quickly? Are the proposed safety measures, like holding limits, enough to prevent this without making the CBDC useless?
12. **The Future of Decentralized Stablecoins:** In a world of regulated, government-approved stablecoins and CBDCs, is there still a long-term role for decentralized stablecoins like DAI? Can they stay relevant for a mainstream audience, or will they be pushed into a small, niche corner of the market?

### The Tech and Operations Side

13. **How Do You Judge Reserve Quality?** Looking past the official reports, what's the best way to really analyze the quality and risk of the reserves backing a stablecoin? What are the biggest red flags to watch out for?
14. **Smart Contract and Oracle Risk:** How can you measure the hidden risks in the smart contracts and oracles that are so central to this ecosystem? What's the "gold standard" for security audits when institutional money is on the line?
15. **The Security of Cross-Chain Bridges:** What are the most secure ways to build bridges between blockchains? Given how many have been hacked, are some models fundamentally safer than others for serious use cases?
16. **What's Next for Programmable Money?** What are the most exciting but still undeveloped uses for programmable money and automated treasury management for big companies? Which industries are likely to benefit the most from these new tools first?
