# Glossary of Key Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key technical and strategic terms used throughout this research.

**Algorithmic Stablecoin**
:   A type of stablecoin that is not backed by any collateral. It attempts to maintain its price peg through algorithms that dynamically manage its circulating supply. This is the most experimental and fragile stablecoin model.

**AML (Anti-Money Laundering)**
:   A set of laws, regulations, and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income.

**Asset-Referenced Token (ART)**
:   The regulatory classification under the EU's MiCA framework for a stablecoin that is pegged to a basket of assets (e.g., multiple fiat currencies, commodities, or crypto-assets).

**Attestation**
:   A formal report from an independent third party (typically a CPA firm) that verifies an assertion made by another party. In the context of stablecoins, it refers to the process of verifying that an issuer's reserves match its circulating token supply.

**CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)**
:   A digital form of a country's fiat currency that is a direct liability of the central bank.

**CEX (Centralized Exchange)**
:   A traditional cryptocurrency exchange operated by a central company (e.g., Coinbase, Binance). They offer fiat on/off-ramps and deep liquidity but require users to custody their assets with the exchange.

**Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)**
:   A smart contract vault, core to crypto-collateralized stablecoins like DAI, where a user locks up collateral to mint (borrow) stablecoins against it.

**Cross-Chain Bridge**
:   A protocol that enables the transfer of assets or data from one blockchain to another. Bridge security is a major challenge in the digital asset space.

**DEX (Decentralized Exchange)**
:   An on-chain exchange that allows users to trade digital assets in a peer-to-peer manner without needing to entrust their funds to a central intermediary.

**E-Money Token (EMT)**
:   The regulatory classification under the EU's MiCA framework for a stablecoin that is pegged to a single fiat currency (e.g., a "digital euro" or "digital dollar").

**KYC (Know Your Customer)**
:   The mandatory process of identifying and verifying the identity of a client. This is a core part of AML regulations.

**KYT (Know Your Transaction)**
:   The process of monitoring cryptocurrency transactions to detect and flag suspicious activity, a key component of a modern blockchain compliance program.

**Liquidation**
:   In a crypto-collateralized stablecoin protocol, the automated process of selling a borrower's collateral when its value falls below a minimum required threshold, ensuring the system remains solvent.

**MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets)**
:   The European Union's comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, which came into full effect in 2024.

**Oracle**
:   A service that connects smart contracts with external, real-world data. Oracles are essential for providing price feeds, weather data, or any other off-chain information to on-chain protocols.

**Over-collateralization**
:   The practice of providing collateral that is worth more than the value of the loan taken against it. This is a key safety mechanism for crypto-collateralized stablecoins to buffer against the price volatility of the underlying collateral.

**Peg**
:   The fixed exchange rate that a stablecoin aims to maintain with its reference asset (e.g., $1.00 USD).

**RWA (Real-World Asset)**
:   A physical or traditional financial asset (e.g., real estate, U.S. T-bills, private credit loans) that has been "tokenized" to create a digital representation of it on a blockchain.

**Smart Contract**
:   A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. They are the foundational building blocks of decentralized applications and protocols.
