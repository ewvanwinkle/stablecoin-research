# 6. Global Regulatory Frameworks

The era of regulatory ambiguity for stablecoins is rapidly coming to an end. Major jurisdictions, most notably the United States and the European Union, are implementing comprehensive legal frameworks. This increasing clarity, while imposing strict compliance requirements, is a primary catalyst for institutional adoption, as it de-risks the asset class and provides a clear path for banks and other regulated entities to engage with stablecoins [\[8\]].

### The United States: The GENIUS Act

The "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act" (GENIUS Act) represents the first major federal effort to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins in the U.S. After passing the Senate in June 2025, it is a landmark piece of legislation [\[41\]].

*   **Core Mandate:** The Act requires stablecoin issuers to maintain **1:1 reserves** with highly liquid assets, such as U.S. dollars or short-term Treasury bills [\[6\]].
*   **Issuer Requirements:** It establishes a clear licensing regime, permitting issuance only by regulated entities, including FDIC-insured banks and federally- or state-qualified nonbank issuers [\[42\]], [\[45\]].
*   **Transparency:** Monthly public disclosures of reserve composition and annual independent audits are mandated to ensure transparency and accountability [\[6\]].
*   **Key Prohibition:** A critical and defining feature of the GENIUS Act is its explicit **prohibition on issuers paying interest or yield** to stablecoin holders [\[41\]], [\[44\]]. This is intended to ensure stablecoins function as pure payment instruments rather than speculative investments, thereby protecting the traditional banking system from disintermediation.

> **The Ban on Yield is a Critical Constraint**
> The prohibition on paying interest directly on payment stablecoins within the U.S. is the single most important feature of the GENIUS Act. It fundamentally bifurcates the market between pure payment stablecoins and separate, regulated yield-bearing products (like tokenized money market funds). This creates a regulatory moat for the traditional banking system and will shape product development and investment strategy in the U.S. market.

### The European Union: Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)

The EU's MiCA regulation, which came into full effect in early 2025, provides a broad framework for all crypto-assets, with specific rules for stablecoins (referred to as "e-money tokens" or "asset-referenced tokens") [\[58\]].

*   **Issuer Requirements:** Issuers must be authorized as a credit institution or an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) and must publish a detailed whitepaper for their token [\[58\]].
*   **Monetary Sovereignty:** A primary goal of MiCA is to protect the monetary sovereignty of the Euro. The framework includes strict rules and potential caps on large, foreign currency-denominated stablecoins to prevent "digital dollarization" and ensure the ECB maintains control over monetary policy [\[49\]].
*   **Impact on Market:** MiCA's strict requirements have already led major exchanges like Binance to delist non-compliant stablecoins for their European users, demonstrating the regulation's significant market impact [\[21\]].

### Comparison of U.S. and EU Approaches

While both frameworks aim for consumer protection and financial stability, their underlying strategic goals diverge significantly.

| Feature                 | U.S. GENIUS Act                                    | EU MiCA Framework                                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Focus**       | Payment Stablecoins                                | All Crypto-Assets (including stablecoins)                 |
| **Strategic Goal**      | Solidify USD dominance via private sector [\[46\]]     | Protect Euro sovereignty via public oversight [\[49\]]      |
| **Yield/Interest**      | Explicitly **prohibited** [\[41\]]                       | Prohibited for fiat-pegged stablecoins [\[54\]]             |
| **Issuer Licensing**    | Bank and nonbank issuers under federal/state charter | Credit Institutions or EMIs [\[58\]]                          |
| **Impact on Foreign Coins** | Focus on regulating U.S. user access           | Can restrict/halt issuance of large foreign coins [\[16\]] |

This regulatory divergence is a central feature of the current geopolitical landscape, creating different opportunities and challenges in each market. The U.S. framework is designed to foster a competitive private market for dollar-pegged stablecoins, while the EU's approach is more defensive, aiming to control the digital asset market to protect its own currency and financial system.
