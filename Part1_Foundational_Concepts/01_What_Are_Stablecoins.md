# 1. What Are Stablecoins?

Stablecoins are a class of digital assets engineered to maintain a stable value relative to an external reference asset. This reference is most commonly a traditional fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, but can also be commodities like gold or even a basket of other assets [\[55\]]. The foundational concept for stablecoins emerged as a direct response to the extreme price volatility inherent in early cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which hindered their use as a reliable medium of exchange [\[14\]].

> **A Bridge Between Two Worlds**
> Stablecoins are best understood as the critical bridge connecting the legacy financial system (TradFi) with the emerging world of decentralized finance (DeFi). They offer the stability of traditional money combined with the speed and efficiency of digital assets [\[10\]].

The primary purpose of stablecoins is to merge the technological advantages of cryptocurrencies—such as speed, low transaction costs, and borderless transfers—with the price stability of traditional currencies [\[2\]]. This unique combination positions them as a critical bridge between the worlds of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) [\[10\]].

### Core Characteristics and Market Role

The utility of stablecoins is multifaceted, extending far beyond simple price stability. Key characteristics include:

*   **Price Stability:** By pegging their value to a stable asset, they provide a reliable and predictable medium of exchange and store of value, which is essential for commercial transactions and financial planning [\[1\]].
*   **Efficiency and Speed:** Stablecoin transactions can be settled nearly instantaneously, 24/7, anywhere in the world, bypassing the slower and more costly traditional banking system [\[10\]]. In 2024, stablecoin networks processed over $27 trillion in transaction volume, a figure that surpassed the combined total of payment giants Visa and Mastercard, demonstrating their scale and efficiency [\[8\]], [\[19\]].
*   **Financial Inclusion:** They offer a powerful tool for financial inclusion, providing access to stable currency and financial services for individuals in regions with volatile economies or underdeveloped banking infrastructure [\[1\]].
*   **DeFi Integration:** Stablecoins are the lifeblood of the decentralized finance ecosystem. They serve as the primary source of liquidity for lending protocols, a stable unit of account for trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXes), and the fundamental building block for complex yield-farming strategies [\[55\]].
*   **Systemic Importance:** The total market capitalization of stablecoins now exceeds 1% of the U.S. M2 money supply, and issuers have become one of the largest holders of U.S. Treasuries globally, highlighting their growing integration into the sovereign financial system [\[7\]], [\[19\]].

This combination of stability, efficiency, and programmability has made stablecoins an indispensable infrastructural layer for the entire digital asset economy, enabling practical, real-world applications beyond speculation [\[55\]].
