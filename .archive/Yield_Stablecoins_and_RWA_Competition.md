# **The Evolving Competitive Landscape of Yield-Bearing Stablecoins and Tokenized Real-World Assets**

## **I. Executive Summary**

The digital asset landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by the increasing demand for stable, yield-generating digital assets and a growing institutional embrace of on-chain financial products. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the competitive dynamics within the burgeoning markets for yield-bearing stablecoins (YBSs) and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Leading providers, including established financial giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, alongside crypto-native innovators such as Ondo Finance, Ethena, Paxos, Centrifuge, and OpenEden, are actively shaping this evolving ecosystem. Their strategies diverge in terms of underlying collateral, yield generation mechanisms, regulatory approaches, and target markets, yet collectively they are advancing the convergence of traditional finance with blockchain technology. This analysis highlights how these entities are leveraging blockchain's inherent efficiencies to create new financial primitives, enhance liquidity, and expand investment accessibility, while navigating a complex and evolving global regulatory environment.

## **II. Introduction to Yield-Bearing Stablecoins and Tokenized Real-World Assets**

### **A. Defining Yield-Bearing Stablecoins: Mechanisms and Value Proposition**

Yield-bearing stablecoins (YBSs) represent a sophisticated class of digital assets engineered to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency such as the US Dollar, while concurrently offering opportunities for generating returns.1 This dual functionality distinguishes YBSs from conventional stablecoins, which primarily serve as a stable medium of exchange or a reliable store of value without an inherent yield component.2

The generation of yield in YBSs is achieved through diverse financial strategies and the utilization of various underlying assets.2 These mechanisms frequently involve participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, such as lending assets on specialized platforms, contributing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), or engaging in staking protocols.1 For instance, Aave's aUSD token leverages deposited stablecoins for lending operations, allowing users to earn interest on their holdings. Similarly, liquidity providers on platforms like Curve Finance generate revenue through a share of trading fees and interest by facilitating stablecoin swaps within liquidity pools.1

The emergence of YBSs is a direct market response to the demand for digital assets that offer both stability and the potential for returns, without exposing users to the pronounced price volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.1 This innovation facilitates broader participation in decentralized financial activities, enabling users to earn passive income on their stablecoin holdings.1 The development of yield-bearing stablecoins marks a significant advancement in the digital asset space, effectively bridging the traditional finance concept of interest-bearing deposits with the efficiency and accessibility afforded by blockchain technology. This innovation directly addresses the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding stable assets within the dynamic DeFi environment, thereby driving capital efficiency and attracting a wider spectrum of investors seeking predictable returns. The evolution of these assets indicates a maturation of the DeFi market, where optimizing capital utilization has become a paramount consideration.

Stablecoins, whether yield-bearing or not, can be broadly categorized based on their underlying collateral mechanisms and the degree of centralization involved in their issuance and management. These distinctions are crucial for understanding their stability, risk profiles, and operational models.

| Category | Collateral Mechanism | Centralization Implications | Yield-Bearing Potential | Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Fiat-Collateralized | 1:1 fiat currency in traditional bank accounts | Centralized issuer, requires trust in custodian | Often non-yield-bearing by design; yield from reserve investments | USDC, USDT, EURC 3 |
| Crypto-Collateralized | Overcollateralized with other cryptocurrencies | Decentralized, relies on smart contracts & oracles | Can be yield-bearing through lending/staking protocols | DAI, FRAX 3 |
| Algorithmic | No collateral; supply/demand algorithms | Highly decentralized, relies on code | Yield often generated by protocol mechanisms | USDe 9 |
| Commodity-Backed | 1:1 physical commodity reserves | Centralized custodian for physical asset | Can be yield-bearing if underlying commodity generates income | PAXG, XAUT 4 |

### **B. Defining Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs): Tokenization Process and Asset Classes**

Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) are digital tokens issued on a blockchain that represent specific rights or ownership interests in assets existing outside the blockchain.12 These assets encompass a wide spectrum, from traditional financial instruments like stocks, bonds, and private equity to tangible assets such as real estate, commodities (e.g., gold), art, and even intellectual property rights.12 The tokenization process transforms these traditional assets into digital tokens, enabling their management and transfer on a blockchain, which can significantly enhance their liquidity and accessibility.15

The process of tokenizing real-world assets is a multi-stage endeavor designed to ensure regulatory compliance and maximize the value proposition of the digitized asset. This intricate process typically involves seven key steps 16:

1. **Asset Selection and Evaluation:** The initial phase involves identifying a real-world asset with strong potential for tokenization. This includes a thorough assessment to ensure the asset meets all eligibility and regulatory requirements, followed by a meticulous valuation and comprehensive documentation in accordance with standard financial practices.  
2. **Legal Structuring:** A robust legal framework is established to ensure that the digital tokens accurately represent valid claims to the underlying real-world assets. This critical step defines the specific rights associated with the tokens and involves selecting an appropriate tokenization structure. Common approaches include the **Tokenized Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)**, which involves holding the asset within a legal entity (e.g., a private limited company or a trust) that is then tokenized, granting investors indirect ownership interests. This indirect tokenization method is often favored for its alignment with existing securities regulations. Less common is **Direct Asset Tokenization**, where the asset itself is directly tokenized, representing a direct claim on the underlying asset; this approach faces more regulatory hurdles, non-fungibility issues, and limited use cases.  
3. **Custody of the RWA and RWA Tokens:** Prior to digitalization, the underlying physical RWA is securely custodized to ensure its immobilization and safekeeping. For tangible, movable assets like fine art or commodities, they are stored and managed by qualified third-party custodians or licensed managers. The digital RWA tokens, representing ownership, can be held in two ways: **self-custody**, where users retain full control over their private keys and are responsible for managing their assets, or with a **licensed third-party custodian**, who provides secure storage and management services in compliance with stringent regulatory requirements. These custodians often employ advanced security protocols such as multi-party computation (MPC), multi-signature (multisig) wallets, and hardware security modules (HSMs), while adhering to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules.17  
4. **Token Issuance:** In this phase, the representation of asset ownership is converted into digital tokens (RWA tokens) on a chosen blockchain. These tokens are then launched, either directly on the RWA issuer’s website or through a licensed tokenization platform.  
5. **Primary Token Offering:** This involves the initial sale of newly issued RWA tokens (which can represent equity or debt) by a company to a specific class of investors. This process allows the company to raise capital directly from investors for various corporate purposes.  
6. **Secondary Trading:** Following the primary offering, RWA tokens can be traded on secondary markets through various channels, including licensed RWA broker-dealer platforms, dedicated RWA exchanges, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that utilize Automated Market Maker (AMM) models. This secondary market activity significantly enhances the liquidity of traditionally illiquid assets.12  
7. **Ongoing Management:** This final phase encompasses continuous services throughout the token's lifespan until its maturity or redemption. These services include ensuring ongoing regulatory compliance, managing tax obligations, conducting regular asset valuations, and facilitating corporate actions such as dividend distribution and voting rights.16

The tokenization of real-world assets is poised to redefine asset ownership and market access fundamentally. The rigorous emphasis on legal structuring and regulated custody within the tokenization process demonstrates a clear and deliberate pathway towards institutional adoption. This approach directly addresses key concerns within traditional finance regarding legal enforceability and the security of assets in the digital realm. The advantages offered by tokenization directly challenge the inherent inefficiencies and exclusivity often found in traditional asset markets. By enabling fractional ownership, enhancing accessibility and liquidity, increasing transparency, reducing transaction costs, and accelerating transaction speeds, RWA tokenization is not merely a technological novelty but a disruptive force aiming to democratize and optimize global financial markets.12

### **C. Market Landscape and Growth Trajectory**

The market for stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets is currently experiencing significant growth and a notable surge in institutional interest. This expansion signifies a pivotal shift in the broader financial ecosystem, moving beyond the speculative nature often associated with early-stage cryptocurrencies towards integrated, efficient digital financial instruments.

The total supply of stablecoins has seen a substantial increase, now exceeding $247 billion and representing over 1% of the US M2 money supply.19 This growth underscores their increasing acceptance as a digital form of currency. Within the tokenized RWA sector, tokenized Treasury bonds alone have reached a cumulative value of $4 billion 14, indicating a clear preference for stable, government-backed assets among early institutional adopters. More broadly, assets in yield-bearing stablecoins and tokenized treasuries collectively witnessed a remarkable 490% surge in 2024, now approaching $10 billion.20 This rapid accumulation of value highlights a strong demand for digital assets that offer both stability and a return on investment.

A compelling indicator of their growing utility is the transaction volume of stablecoins, which reached an impressive $27.6 trillion in 2024\. This figure notably surpassed the combined transaction volumes of traditional payment giants Visa and Mastercard by over 7.68%.21 This remarkable volume is a crucial indicator that stablecoins are proving to be a more efficient and scalable payment mechanism in various contexts. The inherent advantages of stablecoins, such such as lower transaction costs and faster settlement speeds, are direct contributors to this increasing efficiency and adoption.22

Industry projections reflect continued optimism for this sector. Citi, for instance, estimates that the total stablecoin market could reach a substantial size of $1.6 trillion by 2030\.20 This forward-looking assessment indicates that the current growth is not perceived as a fleeting trend but rather a foundational change in the financial infrastructure. The significant institutional capital flowing into these assets, as evidenced by BlackRock's and Franklin Templeton's initiatives, further reinforces this perspective.14 This influx of institutional participation points towards a growing convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), where established financial players are increasingly leveraging blockchain technology for its inherent efficiencies and capabilities. The trajectory suggests a future where digital assets are not merely an alternative but an integral component of the global financial system.

## **III. Competitive Landscape: Leading Providers and Their Differentiators**

The competitive landscape for yield-bearing stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets is dynamic, with both traditional financial powerhouses and innovative crypto-native firms vying for market share. Each player brings a distinct strategic approach, leveraging unique differentiators in product design, regulatory compliance, and target market focus.

### **A. BlackRock: Institutionalizing Digital Assets**

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has made a significant foray into the tokenized RWA space with the launch of its **BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)**. This initiative represents a pivotal moment in the institutional adoption of digital assets.23

BUIDL is structured as a tokenized money market fund, designed specifically for large financial institutions, corporations, and qualified investors seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market within a regulated and secure environment.24 The fund exclusively invests in U.S. dollar-denominated assets, primarily consisting of highly liquid, short-term U.S. Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements.23 This deliberate focus on low-risk, traditional financial instruments is a strategic move to align with the stringent capital preservation and stability mandates of institutional clients.

The fund's yield generation mechanism is a key differentiator: it accrues and pays daily dividends monthly directly to investors' wallets in the form of new BUIDL tokens.23 This "yield-bearing" feature provides a consistent income stream with minimal risk, setting it apart from many non-yielding stablecoins and appealing directly to institutions seeking productive asset deployment. BUIDL operates on a permissioned blockchain network, which enhances regulatory compliance and security through controlled access.24 Its native issuance across multiple prominent blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon, demonstrates a commitment to broad interoperability and accessibility for its qualified investor base.23 The fund has experienced rapid growth, quickly expanding from $667 million to $1.8 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM) within three weeks of its launch, and subsequently reaching $2.88 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL).23 This rapid capital accumulation underscores robust institutional demand and confidence in BlackRock's offering.

BlackRock's strategic approach to tokenization is framed as a multi-stage revolution aimed at migrating traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate onto blockchain infrastructure.14 BUIDL is positioned within "Stage 2: Government Bond Revolution," where BlackRock is actively driving the institutionalization of crypto under carefully controlled environments.14 Their strategy involves methodically laying the groundwork for eventual "Stage 4: Mass Adoption and Innovation," where tokenization is envisioned to become the default standard rather than an exception.14 By focusing on familiar, highly regulated assets first, BlackRock aims to build trust and robust infrastructure, rather than immediately venturing into more speculative or less regulated asset classes.14 Furthermore, BlackRock's significant investment in Securitize, a real-world asset tokenization firm, highlights its commitment to developing the necessary institutional-grade tokenization infrastructure to support its long-term vision.14

BlackRock's entry into the tokenized RWA space with BUIDL serves as a powerful validation of the sector's legitimacy and its substantial future potential for institutional capital. The firm's methodical, compliance-focused approach, beginning with low-risk government bonds and leveraging existing financial structures, positions it as a leading force in bridging traditional finance with blockchain. This strategic posture establishes a significant precedent for other large asset managers, potentially influencing the overall direction of institutional RWA tokenization towards more centralized or hybrid models that prioritize regulatory adherence and investor protection. The choice of highly liquid, low-risk US Treasuries as underlying assets, combined with operations on permissioned networks and targeting qualified investors, directly addresses the primary concerns of traditional financial institutions regarding risk and regulatory clarity, thereby fostering greater adoption.

### **B. Ondo Finance: Bridging Traditional and Decentralized Finance**

Ondo Finance has positioned itself as a key player in bridging traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi) by tokenizing stable assets from conventional markets, such as U.S. Treasuries and money market funds.27

Ondo's product suite includes the **USDY (US Dollar Yield Token)** and the **OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Treasuries Fund)**. USDY is a tokenized note backed by short-term US Treasuries and bank demand deposits, designed to offer a high-quality, US dollar-denominated yield.28 USDY holders can receive yield in two primary forms: as an

**accumulating token**, where the per-token price increases as the yield accrues, or as a **rebasing token (rUSDY)**, where the price remains fixed at $1.00 and users receive additional tokens as yield is generated.28 The OUSG fund provides exposure to short-term US Treasuries and money market instruments.27 A notable aspect of OUSG is its underlying investment strategy: over 99% of its assets are invested in BlackRock's BUIDL fund, effectively making OUSG a feeder fund to BlackRock's institutional product.32 This direct linkage to a major traditional asset manager's offering underscores Ondo's strategy of leveraging established TradFi instruments to build its digital asset products.

Ondo Finance differentiates itself through several key strategic pillars. Its **regulatory-first design** is paramount, with the platform built to incorporate features like permissioned lending, transfer restrictions, and Know Your Customer (KYC) integrations to ensure alignment with securities laws and FATF guidelines.29 This proactive approach to compliance is a significant draw for institutional participants. Furthermore, USDY is issued by Ondo USDY LLC, which is structured to be

**"bankruptcy-remote"**.29 This legal framework is designed to protect USDY holders from the bankruptcy risk of other Ondo operating companies, providing an enhanced layer of investor protection that is crucial for attracting cautious capital. Ondo also employs a robust

**multi-chain strategy**, with USDY expanding its availability across numerous blockchain networks including Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Sui, Aptos, Mantle Network, Plume Network, and Noble.29 This broad compatibility aims to offer users extensive flexibility and reach within the digital asset ecosystem. Finally, Ondo's

**strategic acquisition of Oasis Pro**, an SEC-registered broker-dealer and RWA infrastructure provider, significantly strengthens its tokenized security offerings in the United States, providing a critical foothold in the regulated tokenized securities market.34

The target market and access restrictions for Ondo's products vary based on regulatory considerations. USDY is primarily accessible to non-US individual and institutional investors and is explicitly *not* offered or sold in the United States or to US persons due to its non-registration under the US Securities Act of 1933\.28 The minimum investment for USDY is $500, with larger investments ($100,000+) supporting USD bank wires.37 A distinctive feature of USDY is the 40-50 day waiting period before tokens become transferable after deposit, a mechanism implemented to ensure compliance with legal requirements.29 In contrast, OUSG is specifically available for Qualified Purchasers and Accredited Investors, indicating a clear focus on sophisticated institutional players.38

Ondo Finance distinguishes itself by meticulously developing compliant, institutional-grade products that effectively bridge TradFi yields with DeFi accessibility. Its strategic reliance on established financial instruments, such as its investment in BlackRock BUIDL, combined with innovative legal structures like bankruptcy-remote Special Purpose Vehicles, and a broad multi-chain presence, positions it as a leading provider for regulated on-chain yield. The segmented market access, differentiating between US and non-US investors, clearly illustrates the critical impact of evolving global regulations on product distribution. This approach reflects a deep understanding of the need to adapt product offerings and target markets to navigate fragmented global regulatory environments, rather than attempting a one-size-fits-all solution. The deliberate 40-50 day lock-up period for USDY is a direct consequence of this focus on compliance.

### **C. Other Key Players and Their Distinctive Offerings**

Beyond BlackRock and Ondo Finance, several other entities are making significant strides in the yield-bearing stablecoin and tokenized RWA sectors, each with unique models and differentiators.

#### **Ethena (USDe, USDtb): Synthetic Dollar Model, Delta-Neutral Hedging, and Yield Sources**

Ethena offers **USDe**, a synthetic dollar stablecoin built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to maintain a $1 peg without relying on traditional fiat reserves or centralized custodians, instead utilizing a novel, crypto-native approach.10 The collateral for USDe consists of various crypto assets, including Ethereum (ETH), staked ETH (stETH), and Bitcoin (BTC), combined with a

**delta-neutral hedging strategy** using short perpetual futures contracts.10 This strategy involves balancing long spot crypto positions with equivalent short futures positions to offset price fluctuations, ensuring stability. Yield for USDe holders is primarily generated from funding rates in perpetual futures markets and rewards derived from liquid staked ETH and other stablecoins held in reserve.10

**sUSDe** is the staked version of USDe, designed to automatically earn yield through a non-rebasing model where the token balance remains constant, but its underlying value increases over time.10

Ethena also introduced **USDtb**, a stablecoin directly backed by BlackRock's BUIDL fund.26 This product offers a distinct risk profile compared to USDe, functioning more like a traditional stablecoin with a direct link to tokenized US Treasuries. USDtb's reserves are predominantly composed of BUIDL (90%), with the remaining portion held in stablecoins to facilitate redemptions.41

Ethena's competitive approach is defined by its innovative, crypto-native stablecoin design, particularly with USDe, which challenges conventional collateral models by offering a decentralized, yield-bearing synthetic dollar. The strategic introduction of USDtb demonstrates a calculated diversification to cater to institutional demand for direct exposure to tokenized traditional finance assets. This dual strategy aims to capture liquidity from both the DeFi and TradFi ecosystems. However, novel yield-bearing stablecoin models, such as Ethena's, can face significant regulatory scrutiny, as evidenced by actions from regulators like BaFin in Germany concerning compliance and classification.11 This highlights the ongoing challenges for decentralized innovations in navigating established financial regulations, which can impact their long-term viability and market accessibility.

#### **Paxos (Lift Dollar USDL, Global Dollar USDG): Regulatory Compliance Across Jurisdictions and Yield Mechanisms**

Paxos is recognized as a leading regulated blockchain infrastructure and tokenization platform, prioritizing compliance across its digital asset offerings.42

Its product portfolio includes the **Lift Dollar (USDL)** and the **Global Dollar (USDG)**. USDL, issued by Paxos International (an affiliate), is a yield-bearing regulated stablecoin that generates its yield from a meticulously managed reserve of short-term, high-quality liquid US government securities.42 USDL employs a

**rebasing mechanism**, where the token balance of eligible holders increases over time to reflect the accrued yield.45 It operates under the regulatory oversight of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) in Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).42

The Global Dollar (USDG) is a global stablecoin that has achieved regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions, including the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA), and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).42 USDG is fully backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US government securities, and other high-quality liquid assets.46 The Global Dollar Network (GDN), which supports USDG, aims to accelerate stablecoin adoption by incentivizing partners for their contributions, with some partners offering yields on USDG holdings.42

Paxos's primary competitive advantage stems from its unwavering commitment to regulatory compliance across various leading financial jurisdictions. This strategic focus positions Paxos as a highly trusted provider for institutions and enterprises seeking regulated digital asset solutions, including both yield-bearing stablecoins and those primarily focused on global payments. The consistent emphasis on "regulated" status and adherence to specific regulatory bodies indicates that Paxos's core business model is built around providing compliant services. This is a critical factor for institutional adoption, where regulatory certainty is paramount. The multi-jurisdictional regulatory compliance for USDG highlights a strategy for global market penetration, aiming to establish USDG as a leading regulated stablecoin for international transactions. Furthermore, USDL's rebasing mechanism showcases a distinct approach to yield distribution, while the Global Dollar Network's model of rewarding partners demonstrates an ecosystem-building strategy designed to encourage broader adoption and utility for USDG beyond simple holding.

#### **Franklin Templeton: Pioneering Tokenized Money Market Funds and Intraday Yield Innovation**

Franklin Templeton, a global investment management organization, has distinguished itself by being the first major asset manager to register a tokenized money market fund.47

Their proprietary **Benji Technology Platform** is a blockchain-integrated stack designed to facilitate the trading, management, and administration of token-based investments.48 This platform is also available as a white-label solution for other banks and asset managers, indicating a broader strategy to become a foundational infrastructure provider in the tokenization space.48 Franklin Templeton's tokenized money market funds, such as the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX), invest in US government securities and money market instruments, offering competitive yields directly to shareholders.48

A significant innovation introduced by Franklin Templeton is the patent-pending **Intraday Yield** feature.48 This technology enables the proportional calculation and distribution of yield down to the second, even when a tokenized security is transferred mid-day.48 This represents a substantial improvement over the traditional industry standard, where share ownership for yield calculation is typically determined by an end-of-day snapshot and distributions are often monthly.48 The Benji Technology Platform serves a diverse target market, including retail and institutional investors, corporate treasurers, venture capital firms, and hedge funds.49 Franklin Templeton further expanded its market reach by securing regulatory approval to launch the first retail tokenized fund in Singapore in 2025\.48

Franklin Templeton's competitive edge is rooted in its pioneering role in tokenizing traditional money market funds and its groundbreaking "Intraday Yield" feature. This demonstrates how established financial institutions are leveraging blockchain to enhance existing products with superior efficiency and granular yield distribution, appealing to a broad spectrum of investors from retail to institutional. Being the first in this specific RWA segment establishes them as an innovator. The "Intraday Yield" feature directly improves upon the limitations of traditional money market funds, offering a tangible benefit to investors by enabling a new, more efficient financial primitive that was previously impractical. The availability of their platform as a white-label solution indicates a strategic move to expand their revenue model beyond direct fund management, positioning them as an infrastructure provider for other financial institutions seeking to enter the tokenization market.

#### **Centrifuge: Focus on Private Credit Tokenization and Institutional RWA Market Access**

Centrifuge operates as a multichain RWA tokenization protocol with a specialized focus on bringing private credit and fixed income assets onto the blockchain.47 This distinct specialization sets it apart from platforms primarily focused on public securities.

The platform tokenizes a diverse range of private credit assets, enabling investors to lend and borrow against these tokenized RWAs.51 These assets include asset-backed securities (ABS), private credit, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLO), and receivables financing.51 Centrifuge's RWA Market is explicitly designed for institutional investors, aiming to enhance liquidity and provide efficient access to capital within this traditionally illiquid asset class.51 A significant differentiator is its status as the first permissioned RWA market integrated with

**Coinbase Verifications**.51 This integration dramatically streamlines the Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for 125 million Coinbase users, enabling single-click onboarding and effectively addressing a major barrier to entry for large-scale institutional capital.

In terms of technology and interoperability, Centrifuge enables fund managers to issue tokenized assets across various blockchains, including Ethereum and Base.47 Centrifuge V3, in conjunction with the Wormhole multi-chain bridge, facilitates composability across DeFi, allowing investors to access tokenized private credit and fixed income from a single dashboard.47

Centrifuge carves out a unique competitive position by concentrating on the tokenization of traditionally illiquid private credit and fixed income assets, specifically targeting institutional investors. Its emphasis on compliant, permissioned access and simplified institutional onboarding through Coinbase Verifications directly addresses a significant barrier to entry for large-scale capital. This positions Centrifuge as a critical infrastructure provider for expanding the RWA market beyond publicly traded securities. The strategic choice to specialize in private credit, coupled with an innovative solution for compliant institutional access, demonstrates a deep understanding of market needs and regulatory realities, providing a clear pathway for institutional capital to flow into a previously inaccessible digital asset class.

#### **Circle (USDC, EURC, USYC): Market Dominance in Regulated Stablecoins and Diversification Strategy**

Circle is a prominent issuer of regulated stablecoins, most notably **USDC**, which holds the position of the world's second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization.20

Circle's comprehensive product portfolio includes:

* **USDC:** A widely adopted fiat-backed stablecoin, fully backed by highly liquid cash and cash-equivalent assets, maintaining a 1:1 peg to the US dollar.3 It boasts extensive interoperability, being natively issued on 23 blockchain networks.3 Circle's primary revenue stream is generated from investing its USDC reserves in short-term US Treasuries.20  
* **EURC:** A euro-backed stablecoin that leads the market among euro-pegged stablecoins with a $224 million market cap.20 It aims to combine the familiarity of the euro with the efficiency of blockchain technology for seamless payments.53  
* **USYC (Circle US Yield Coin):** This is a yield-bearing treasury token initially issued by Hashnote and subsequently acquired by Circle in January 2025\.20 USYC is backed by short-term U.S. Treasury securities and reverse repurchase agreements, generating yield based on the overnight federal funds rate.54 Due to regulatory restrictions, USYC is exclusively available to non-U.S. Persons.55

Circle's competitive strategy is underpinned by a strong emphasis on **regulatory compliance**. USDC is strategically positioned as a compliant bridge between the crypto ecosystem and traditional finance in the U.S. Similarly, EURC has gained prominence in the EU market, benefiting from the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which has led to the delisting of non-compliant stablecoins from major regulated exchanges.20 Beyond stablecoin issuance, Circle offers a suite of infrastructure and services, including Circle Mint (for institutional minting and redemption), the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) for native USDC transfers across blockchains, and the Circle Payments Network (CPN), envisioned as a programmable settlement layer.20

Circle's competitive advantage is defined by its significant market dominance in regulated fiat-backed stablecoins, its extensive multi-chain interoperability, and its strategic diversification into non-USD stablecoins and yield-bearing tokenized treasuries. This comprehensive approach aims to capture a broad spectrum of the digital asset market, encompassing payments and institutional yield, while proactively navigating global regulatory landscapes. USDC's market position and broad blockchain support highlight Circle's substantial infrastructure and market penetration. The introduction of EURC and the acquisition of USYC demonstrate a deliberate strategy to diversify beyond a single-currency focus and tap into the growing demand for yield-bearing assets. This diversification helps mitigate reliance on USD-specific market dynamics and addresses broader global financial needs. Circle's success with EURC in the EU due to MiCA, and the targeted restriction of USYC to non-US persons, illustrate the company's agility in adapting to and leveraging diverse regulatory environments, effectively transforming compliance into a competitive asset. Furthermore, offerings like CCTP and CPN indicate a strategic vision beyond merely issuing tokens; Circle aims to build foundational payment and settlement infrastructure for the digital economy, potentially positioning itself as a challenger to traditional systems like SWIFT.

#### **OpenEden: Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Backed by Tokenized US Treasuries**

OpenEden is a regulated RWA tokenization platform that specializes in offering yield-bearing digital assets directly backed by traditional financial instruments.

Its primary product offerings include **USDO (OpenEden Open Dollar)**, a yield-bearing stablecoin, and the **OpenEden TBILL token**, both directly backed by tokenized U.S. Treasuries.47 This direct backing by government debt provides a clear and understandable source of yield for investors.56 OpenEden places a strong emphasis on transparency and trust, leveraging integrations with

**Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves (POR)** and **Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)**.47 These integrations allow for verifiable proof of reserves on-chain, which is a critical mechanism for building confidence in digital assets by providing transparent and auditable collateral information.

From a regulatory perspective, OpenEden is licensed in Bermuda and BVI, jurisdictions known for their progressive digital asset regulatory frameworks.47 The OpenEden TBILL token further bridges traditional finance with DeFi by holding an

**“A” rating from Moody’s**.47 This incorporation of a familiar, traditional credit rating alongside blockchain technology appeals to a broader institutional audience that relies on established risk assessment tools.

OpenEden differentiates itself by offering yield-bearing stablecoins and RWA tokens with direct, verifiable backing by US Treasuries, enhanced by Chainlink's transparency solutions and traditional credit ratings. This combination is designed to build maximum trust and compliance for institutional investors seeking safe, on-chain yield. The direct backing by US Treasuries for USDO and TBILL provides a transparent and easily understood yield source. The use of Chainlink's Proof of Reserves directly addresses transparency concerns that have historically impacted some stablecoins, fostering confidence through verifiable on-chain data. The Moody's "A" rating for TBILL is a crucial differentiator, as it combines the decentralized transparency of blockchain with the established credibility of traditional financial ratings, appealing to a broader institutional audience that relies on familiar risk assessment tools. Furthermore, being licensed in Bermuda and BVI indicates a strategic choice of jurisdictions with forward-thinking digital asset regulations, enhancing their appeal to compliant investors.

## **IV. Core Technologies and Infrastructure Supporting the Ecosystem**

### **A. Blockchain Networks: Scalability, Costs, and Interoperability**

The choice of the underlying blockchain network is a foundational decision for the issuance, transfer, and overall management of yield-bearing stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. This decision directly influences transaction efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and the reach of these digital financial instruments. The competitive landscape is significantly shaped by the performance characteristics of these underlying networks.

**Ethereum**, as the pioneering smart contract platform, remains a prominent and widely adopted network for stablecoin development, hosting major tokens such as USDT, USDC, and DAI.3 Its robust ecosystem and established developer community have fostered a rich environment for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols.59 However, Ethereum has historically faced challenges related to scalability, high gas fees, and network congestion, particularly during periods of peak demand.3 Gas fees, paid in Ether (ETH), are essential for compensating validators for their computational work and for deterring malicious actors from spamming the network.61 These cost and speed limitations have spurred the development of alternative solutions.

The limitations of Ethereum have led to the rise of highly scalable Layer 1 (L1) blockchains and Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions. **Solana** stands out for its high performance, offering lightning-fast transaction speeds, capable of processing over 2,400 transactions per second, and significantly lower transaction fees (typically around $0.00025 per transaction) compared to Ethereum.3 Its innovative Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism contributes to its remarkable efficiency.64 Major stablecoins like USDT and USDC are also prominently featured on the Solana network, leveraging its speed and low costs for high-volume transactions.3

**Avalanche** employs a unique multi-chain architecture, consisting of the X-Chain (for asset creation and trading), the P-Chain (for coordinating validators and managing subnets), and the C-Chain (for smart contracts compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine).3 This design, along with its customizable subnets, enables high throughput (over 4,500 transactions per second), sub-second transaction finality, and lower transaction fees compared to congested networks like Ethereum.65

**Polygon** functions as a Layer 2 scaling solution built on top of Ethereum, specifically designed to enhance transaction speed and efficiency while substantially reducing costs (typical fees range between $0.0005 and $0.01).63 It aims to provide a more cost-effective and scalable environment for dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces, addressing the scalability bottlenecks of the Ethereum mainnet.69

The **BNB Smart Chain (BSC)**, developed by Binance, offers seamless compatibility with Ethereum's smart contracts, allowing developers to easily migrate or build dApps.3 BSC is known for its impressive transaction throughput and considerably lower fees compared to Ethereum, making it an attractive choice for DeFi applications and stablecoin development.3 Its native token, BNB, is used for gas fees and staking, incentivizing network participation and security.72

**TRON** is another network recognized for its extremely low (or often zero) transaction fees and high transaction processing capability (approximately 2,000 transactions per second).74 TRON has achieved significant market dominance in USDT transfers due to its cost-efficiency, processing over 2.4 million USDT transactions daily with a volume of $23.4 billion in May 2025\.76 This indicates a strong preference for TRON among users seeking fast and inexpensive stablecoin operations, particularly for micropayments and retail transfers.77

The performance characteristics of these underlying blockchain networks profoundly influence the strategies of yield-bearing stablecoin issuers and RWA tokenization platforms. The high gas fees and congestion on Ethereum created a clear need for more efficient transaction environments. This directly led to the development and widespread adoption of alternative Layer 1 solutions and Layer 2 scaling protocols that offer significantly lower fees and higher transaction throughput. As a result, leading providers are increasingly adopting a multi-chain strategy, deploying their stablecoins and tokenized assets across multiple networks to optimize for lower transaction costs and faster settlement times. This strategic imperative is crucial for achieving broader adoption and enhancing capital efficiency within the digital asset ecosystem. The remarkable dominance of TRON in USDT transfers, for example, is a direct consequence of its ability to provide a highly cost-efficient network, demonstrating how network design directly impacts market share for stablecoin usage.

## **V. Conclusion**

The competitive landscape for yield-bearing stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets is characterized by rapid innovation and a strategic convergence of traditional finance with blockchain technology. The market's demand for stable, productive digital assets has driven the emergence of sophisticated financial products that offer yields previously confined to traditional markets, while leveraging the efficiencies of blockchain.

Leading providers are differentiating themselves through a combination of factors:

* **BlackRock** is setting an institutional precedent by tokenizing highly liquid, low-risk government bonds (BUIDL) within a permissioned, compliance-focused framework. Its strategic vision aims to gradually shift traditional assets onto blockchain, prioritizing trust and regulatory adherence.  
* **Ondo Finance** meticulously bridges TradFi yields with DeFi accessibility through products like USDY and OUSG, which often leverage established TradFi instruments like BlackRock's BUIDL. Its emphasis on regulatory-first design, bankruptcy-remote structures, and a multi-chain strategy positions it as a leader in compliant on-chain yield, adapting its market access based on global regulatory environments.  
* **Ethena** offers a crypto-native, synthetic dollar model (USDe) that challenges traditional collateral approaches, generating yield through delta-neutral hedging. Its introduction of USDtb, directly backed by BlackRock BUIDL, demonstrates a strategic diversification to appeal to institutional preferences for direct RWA exposure, navigating the complexities of decentralized innovation and regulatory scrutiny.  
* **Paxos** distinguishes itself through a strong commitment to multi-jurisdictional regulatory compliance for its stablecoins (USDL, USDG), making it a trusted partner for institutions seeking regulated digital asset solutions for global payments and yield.  
* **Franklin Templeton** pioneers the tokenization of money market funds, enhancing existing products with innovations like "Intraday Yield" through its proprietary Benji Technology Platform. This strategy aims to improve efficiency and granular yield distribution, appealing to both retail and institutional investors.  
* **Centrifuge** carves a niche by focusing on the tokenization of traditionally illiquid private credit and fixed income assets, specifically targeting institutional investors. Its streamlined institutional onboarding via Coinbase Verifications addresses a critical barrier to large-scale capital adoption.  
* **OpenEden** provides yield-bearing stablecoins and RWA tokens directly backed by US Treasuries, enhancing trust through Chainlink's Proof of Reserves and integrating traditional credit ratings like Moody's.

The choice of underlying blockchain networks plays a critical role in this competitive dynamic. The high transaction costs and congestion on networks like Ethereum have propelled the adoption of scalable Layer 1 alternatives (Solana, Avalanche, TRON) and Layer 2 solutions (Polygon). These networks offer lower fees and faster settlement times, which are essential for the broad adoption and capital efficiency of yield-bearing stablecoins and tokenized RWAs. The market's trajectory clearly indicates a move towards multi-chain strategies and specialized platforms that can meet diverse investor needs and regulatory requirements.

In conclusion, the competitive landscape is not a zero-sum game but rather an ecosystem of complementary approaches. Traditional financial institutions are leveraging blockchain to enhance existing products, while crypto-native firms are building innovative, decentralized solutions. The success of these providers hinges on their ability to combine robust technology with clear regulatory compliance, transparent asset backing, and efficient yield generation mechanisms. As regulatory frameworks continue to evolve globally, the players that can best adapt to these changes while delivering tangible value through enhanced liquidity, accessibility, and yield will likely define the future of digital finance.
